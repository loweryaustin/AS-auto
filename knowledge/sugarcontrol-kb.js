        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> High blood sugar is not just a number; it is a toxin. Excess glucose acts like microscopic shards of glass in your bloodstream, shredding your nerves (Neuropathy), your eyes (Retinopathy), and your blood vessels (Heart Disease). We must lower the sugar to stop the shredding.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Insulin Resistance:</strong> The lock is broken. Your cells are supposed to open up to let sugar in for energy when Insulin knocks. In Type 2 Diabetes, the cells stop listening. Sugar stays in the blood, causing damage, while the cells starve for energy.</li>
        <li><strong>A1C:</strong> A 3-month average of your blood sugar. It measures what percentage of your red blood cells are sugar-coated (glycated). <br><strong>Normal:</strong> Below 5.7% <br><strong>Diabetes:</strong> 6.5% or higher.</li>
        <li><strong>Neuropathy:</strong> Nerve damage caused by sugar. The "sugar glass" strips the insulation (myelin) off the nerves in the feet and hands, leading to burning, tingling, and eventually numbness.</li>
        <li><strong>Glycation:</strong> The process where sugar binds to proteins and fats, turning them into stiff, sticky sludge. This is what hardens arteries and ages skin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. The Vicious Cycle</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">The "Insulin Trap"</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li>When you eat carbs, sugar goes up.</li>
        <li>Your body floods with Insulin to lower it.</li>
        <li>Insulin is a <strong>Fat Storage Hormone</strong>. It tells your body "Don't burn fat, store it!"</li>
        <li>Because you can't burn fat, you get hungry and tired.</li>
        <li>You eat more carbs for energy. The cycle repeats.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> We must lower Insulin levels to unlock fat burning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Instituto Protocol: Stop the Damage</h2>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Sugar Shield" (Glucose)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> <strong>Sugar Control</strong> helps sensitize your cells to insulin again. It acts like WD-40 for the broken lock, allowing sugar to leave the bloodstream and enter the cells for energy. This naturally lowers A1C and reduces the "shredding" effect.</p>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Wire Repair" (Nerves)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> If you have tingling or numbness, the damage is already done. <strong>Nerve Alive</strong> provides the nutrients to rebuild the nerve insulation (myelin) that sugar has stripped away. This stops the burning and restores sensation.</p>

    <h3 class="text-yellow-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Metabolic Furnace" (Weight)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Fat cells (especially belly fat) release chemicals that <em>cause</em> insulin resistance. Losing weight is the most effective way to reverse Type 2 Diabetes. <strong>Flash Burn</strong> accelerates metabolism to help burn off this toxic fat.</p>

    <h3 class="text-blue-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Stress Spike" (Cortisol)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Stress releases Cortisol. Cortisol tells your liver to dump sugar into the blood for "quick energy" to fight a tiger. If you are stressed all day, your sugar is high all day, even if you eat nothing. <strong>Nerve Alive</strong> calms this stress response.</p>

    <h3 class="text-orange-600 font-bold mt-4">5. The "Vessel Protector" (Circulation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Diabetics have a high risk of heart attack because sugar scars the blood vessels. <strong>Vital Blood</strong> heals the vessel lining and improves flow to the extremities, preventing the complications of poor circulation (like slow wound healing).</p>
