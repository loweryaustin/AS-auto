        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> An erection is a complex hydraulic event. It requires three systems to work perfectly: 1. Blood Flow (The Pump), 2. Nerves (The Signal), and 3. Testosterone (The Fuel). If any one of these fails, the system fails.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Nitric Oxide (NO):</strong> The gas released by blood vessel linings that tells them to relax and open. Without NO, there is no erection.</li>
        <li><strong>Endothelial Dysfunction:</strong> When the inner lining of blood vessels is damaged (by sugar, smoking, or age), it stops producing NO. The vessels remain clamped shut.</li>
        <li><strong>Venous Leak:</strong> A condition where blood flows *out* of the penis as fast as it flows *in*. This causes erections to soften quickly or fail to reach full hardness.</li>
        <li><strong>Free Testosterone:</strong> The tiny percentage of testosterone that is actually available for the body to use. Total T can be high, but if it's bound up (by SHBG), you will still have low libido.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Common Medications vs. Root Cause</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Viagra (Sildenafil) & Cialis (Tadalafil)</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> They block the enzyme (PDE5) that makes an erection go away. They essentially force the "drain" to stay closed.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> They do not fix the "faucet" (blood inflow). If your arteries are clogged or damaged (Tenurina/Cetadusse needed), plugging the drain won't help because no water is coming in.</li>
        <li><strong>Side Effects:</strong> Headaches, flushing, acid reflux, blue-tinted vision, and dangerous drops in blood pressure.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">TRT (Testosterone Injections)</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Injecting synthetic testosterone.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> When you inject T, your body stops making its own. This causes testicular shrinkage and permanent dependence. <strong>Erectozyn</strong> supports natural production instead.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: Why It Fails</h2>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Hydraulic Failure" (Circulation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> The penile arteries are some of the smallest in the body (1-2mm). They clog up *years* before the heart arteries (3-4mm) do. ED is often the first sign of heart disease. <strong>Tenurina</strong> clears plaque and dilates these micro-vessels to restore hydraulic pressure.</p>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Disconnected Wire" (Nerves)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> The brain sends a signal down the spine to the penis. If you have <strong>Diabetes</strong>, high sugar has stripped the insulation off these nerves. The signal never arrives. Or, the signal arrives, but you have no physical sensation (numbness). <strong>Arialief</strong> repairs this wiring.</p>

    <h3 class="text-orange-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Kink in the Hose" (Prostate)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> The prostate surrounds the urethra and the ejaculatory ducts. When it swells (BPH), it physically strangles the plumbing. This restricts blood inflow and causes weak, dribbling ejaculation. <strong>Jertaris</strong> shrinks the gland to remove the physical clamp.</p>

    <h3 class="text-blue-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Vessel Shredder" (Sugar)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> High blood glucose acts like sandpaper on the Endothelium (vessel lining). Scar tissue forms, making the vessels stiff and unable to expand. <strong>Cetadusse</strong> regulates sugar to stop this daily damage.</p>
