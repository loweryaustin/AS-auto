    <h1>Night Renew & Sleep Architecture Deep Dive</h1>
    
    <div class="p-4 bg-indigo-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-indigo-500 mb-6">
        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> Sleep is not just "rest"; it is active biological repair. During Deep Sleep, you repair tissue and muscle. During REM Sleep, you repair the brain and emotions. Night Renew is designed to help you cycle through both stages efficiently.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Circadian Rhythm:</strong> Your internal 24-hour clock regulated by light and darkness. It tells your body when to release Cortisol (wake up) and Melatonin (sleep).</li>
        <li><strong>Glymphatic System:</strong> The brain's waste clearance system. It opens up <em>only</em> during deep sleep to wash away toxic proteins (amyloid plaques) that cause Alzheimer's.</li>
        <li><strong>Cortisol:</strong> The "Stress Hormone." It should be low at night. If it is high (due to stress), it suppresses Melatonin and keeps you "wired and tired."</li>
        <li><strong>Growth Hormone (HGH):</strong> The "Youth Hormone." It repairs skin, burns fat, and builds muscle. It is primarily released during the first few hours of deep sleep.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Why "Knockout Pills" Fail</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Sedation vs. Sleep</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Sleeping pills (Ambien) and alcohol are sedatives. They knock you unconscious.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> Sedation is not sleep. These substances block REM sleep and Deep Sleep. You wake up unconscious for 8 hours but unrested because no repair work happened. Night Renew supports natural sleep cycles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: Why You Can't Sleep</h2>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Stress Wire" (Cortisol)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> If you are stressed, your Cortisol is high. Biologically, your body thinks there is a tiger nearby. It will not let you enter deep sleep because it's not safe. <strong>Nervital</strong> calms the nervous system to signal safety.</p>

    <h3 class="text-yellow-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Sugar Spike" (Glucose)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> If your blood sugar crashes at 3 AM (Hypoglycemia), your body releases adrenaline to wake you up and get food. This is why you wake up suddenly with a racing heart. <strong>Golden Vita Pure</strong> stabilizes sugar to prevent this adrenaline dump.</p>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Hunger Hormone" (Metabolism)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Poor sleep raises Ghrelin (hunger) by 15% and lowers Leptin (fullness) by 15%. You wake up starving and craving carbs. <strong>Lipolyne</strong> helps regulate metabolism to break this cycle.</p>

    <h3 class="text-green-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Brain Trash" (Cognition)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> If you don't sleep, the trash (toxins) in your brain isn't taken out. This leads to severe brain fog and memory loss. <strong>Neurodyne</strong> protects the brain cells from the toxicity of sleep deprivation.</p>
