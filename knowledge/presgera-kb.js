        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> Presgera is our "Senior Formula." While Cetacondor targets Diabetic Neuropathy, Presgera is formulated for <strong>Age-Related Nerve Degeneration</strong>. It focuses heavily on mitochondrial energy (powering the nerve) and circulation.</p>

    <h2>1. The 3 Stages of Nerve Death</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-4">
        <li class="bg-white p-3 rounded shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
            <strong>Stage 1: Irritation (Sensory)</strong><br>
            <span class="text-sm text-gray-600">The insulation is thinning. This causes "cross-talk" between wires.</span><br>
            <span class="text-sm font-semibold text-red-500">Symptoms: Burning, Electric Shocks, Sharp Pains.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="bg-white p-3 rounded shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
            <strong>Stage 2: Damage (Motor)</strong><br>
            <span class="text-sm text-gray-600">The wire itself is degrading. Signals are getting weak.</span><br>
            <span class="text-sm font-semibold text-orange-500">Symptoms: Weakness, cramping, "Heavy Legs," trouble balancing.</span>
        </li>
        <li class="bg-white p-3 rounded shadow-sm border border-gray-200">
            <strong>Stage 3: Death (Numbness)</strong><br>
            <span class="text-sm text-gray-600">The wire is cut. No signal gets through. This is the most dangerous stage because you cannot feel injuries.</span><br>
            <span class="text-sm font-semibold text-gray-500">Symptoms: Complete numbness, "Walking on cotton," loss of feeling.</span>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Why "Just Managing Pain" Fails</h2>
    <p>Most doctors treat Stage 1 (Pain) with painkillers. But as the nerve progresses to Stage 3 (Numbness), the pain stops. The doctor says "Great, the pain is gone!" But in reality, the nerve has died. <strong>Presgera aims to reverse Stage 3 back to Stage 1, and then to healed.</strong></p>
    <p class="text-sm italic mt-2 text-gray-500">*Note: Warn clients that as numbness heals, they may feel "tingling" or "pain" again temporarily. This is a good sign—it means the wire is live again ("Re-Awakening Phenomenon").</p>
