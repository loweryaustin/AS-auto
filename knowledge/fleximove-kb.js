        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> Joints are "avascular," meaning they have very little direct blood flow. They are like a sponge; they need to be squeezed (movement) and soaked (circulation) to get nutrients. Arthritis is often a "dry sponge" problem.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Synovial Fluid:</strong> The egg-white-like fluid that lubricates the joint. As we age or get dehydrated, this dries up, leading to "bone-on-bone" grinding.</li>
        <li><strong>Cartilage:</strong> The shock absorber. It has no nerves, so you don't feel it wearing away until it's gone and the bone is exposed.</li>
        <li><strong>Systemic Inflammation:</strong> Inflammation that comes from the blood (sugar, gut toxins) rather than an injury. It attacks all joints at once.</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanical Stress:</strong> The physical weight placed on the joint. The knee takes 4x your body weight in pressure with every step.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. The "Rust" Causes</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Starved Joint" (Circulation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Because cartilage has no blood vessels, it relies on nutrients diffusing from nearby capillaries. If you have poor circulation (cold hands/feet), the joint starves. <strong>Vital Blood</strong> forces blood into these micro-vessels to "feed" the joint.</p>

    <h3 class="text-orange-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Heavy Load" (Weight)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Physics is brutal. Losing just 10 lbs takes 40 lbs of pressure off your knees. That is a massive reduction in grinding. <strong>Gela Tide</strong> helps control appetite to shed this mechanical load.</p>

    <h3 class="text-yellow-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Sugar Rot" (Glycation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Sugar binds to collagen (the protein in joints) and turns it brittle. This is called Glycation. It makes your joints stiff and prone to cracking. <strong>Gluco Control</strong> stops this process by regulating blood sugar.</p>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "False Alarm" (Nerves)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Sometimes the joint is healing, but the nerves around it are hypersensitive, sending sharp "electric" pains. This is nerve pain, not joint pain. <strong>Nerve Alive</strong> calms these signals so you can move comfortably.</p>

    <h3 class="text-green-600 font-bold mt-4">5. The "Toxic Leak" (Gut)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> "Leaky Gut" allows food particles into the bloodstream. The immune system attacks them, creating inflammation that settles in the joints (Autoimmune/Rheumatoid response). <strong>Flora Zen</strong> seals the gut to stop this attack.</p>
