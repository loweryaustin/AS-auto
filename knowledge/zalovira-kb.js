    <h1>Zalovira & Immune Resilience Deep Dive</h1>
    
    <div class="p-4 bg-red-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-red-500 mb-6">
        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> Immunity is not just about avoiding a cold; it is about resilience. A strong immune system identifies threats instantly and neutralizes them before you even feel sick. Zalovira provides the "ammunition" (Zinc, Vitamin C, Elderberry) your internal army needs to fight.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Innate Immunity:</strong> Your body's first line of defense (skin, mucus, stomach acid). It attacks anything that looks foreign immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Adaptive Immunity:</strong> The "Special Forces." It remembers past infections (antibodies) and attacks specific threats. This system weakens with age (Immunosenescence).</li>
        <li><strong>Cytokines:</strong> Signaling molecules that tell immune cells where to go. Chronic inflammation causes a "Cytokine Storm" that can damage healthy tissue.</li>
        <li><strong>GALT (Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissue):</strong> The massive immune command center located in your intestines. 70-80% of immune cells live here.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Why "Boosting" Isn't Enough</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">The Inflammation Trap</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> If your body is chronically inflamed (due to diet, stress, or weight), your immune system is already "busy" fighting a false war. It has no resources left for real threats like viruses.</li>
        <li><strong>The Solution:</strong> You don't just need to boost immunity; you need to lower inflammation (Resverador) and clear the gut (GoldenFrib) so the immune system can focus.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: Why Defenses Fail</h2>

    <h3 class="text-green-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Gut Breach" (Microbiome)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> If your gut lining is damaged (Leaky Gut), toxins leak into the blood. The immune system attacks these toxins 24/7, leaving it exhausted. <strong>GoldenFrib</strong> seals the breach so your immune system can rest and recharge.</p>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Recharge Failure" (Sleep)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> T-cells (fighter cells) are produced and released primarily during deep sleep. If you sleep 6 hours or less, your natural killer cell activity drops by up to 70%. <strong>Xelovita</strong> guarantees the sleep needed to restock your army.</p>

    <h3 class="text-yellow-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Sugar Coma" (Diet)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Eating 100g of sugar (a soda and a candy bar) reduces the ability of white blood cells to kill bacteria by 40% for up to 5 hours. <strong>Cetadusse</strong> regulates sugar to keep your white blood cells aggressive and active.</p>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Transport Block" (Circulation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Immune cells travel in the bloodstream. If you have poor circulation (cold hands/feet), your army cannot reach the battlefield (the infection site). <strong>Tenurina</strong> opens the roads to ensure rapid deployment.</p>
