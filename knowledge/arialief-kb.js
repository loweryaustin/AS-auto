        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> Neuropathy is not a disease; it is the *result* of damage to your wiring. Your nerves are electrical wires. The insulation (Myelin) is being stripped off, causing short circuits (pain) and eventually dead wires (numbness).</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Peripheral Neuropathy:</strong> Damage to the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord (hands and feet). It usually starts at the furthest point (toes) and works its way up.</li>
        <li><strong>Myelin Sheath:</strong> The fatty protective coating around your nerves (like the rubber coating on a phone charger). When this is damaged, the "bare wire" is exposed, causing burning pain.</li>
        <li><strong>Axon:</strong> The core of the nerve fiber. If the Myelin is damaged for too long, the Axon dies. This is when pain turns into permanent numbness.</li>
        <li><strong>Paresthesia:</strong> The medical term for "pins and needles," tingling, or the feeling of ants crawling on the skin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. The "Band-Aid" Medications</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Gabapentin (Neurontin) & Lyrica (Pregabalin)</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> These are anti-seizure medications. They work by blocking calcium channels in the brain to "turn down the volume" on pain signals.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> They do <strong>zero</strong> repair work. Imagine your house is on fire (nerve damage), and you just turn off the fire alarm (Gabapentin). The house is still burning.</li>
        <li><strong>Side Effects:</strong> "Brain Fog," severe drowsiness, dizziness (fall risk), and weight gain.</li>
        <li><strong>Our Approach:</strong> We don't mask the signal; we repair the wire so it stops sending the distress signal.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: Why Nerves Die</h2>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Sugar Glass" Effect (Diabetes)</h3>
    <p>High blood sugar is the #1 killer of nerves. Excess glucose in the blood becomes sharp and abrasive on a microscopic level. It literally shreds the delicate Myelin Sheath like sandpaper. <strong>Cetadusse</strong> is required to stop this "sandpapering" so healing can begin.</p>

    <h3 class="text-blue-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The Starvation Effect (Circulation)</h3>
    <p>Nerves are living tissue; they need food (oxygen/nutrients). They get this from microscopic blood vessels (capillaries). High BP or cholesterol clogs these tiny vessels. The nerve starves to death. <strong>Tenurina</strong> forces these vessels open to "feed" the dying nerve.</p>

    <h3 class="text-orange-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The Compression Effect (Inflammation)</h3>
    <p>If the tissue surrounding the nerve is inflamed (from arthritis or injury), it swells and crushes the nerve. It's like stepping on a hose. <strong>Resverador</strong> reduces this systemic swelling to take the pressure off the wire.</p>
