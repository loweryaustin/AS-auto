        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> Nerves are the "wiring" of your body. When the insulation (Myelin) is damaged, the wire "shorts out" (Pain/Tingling). If the damage continues, the wire eventually snaps (Numbness). Nervital provides the raw materials to re-insulate the wire, while the rest of the stack clears the environment so healing can occur.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Peripheral Neuropathy:</strong> Damage to the communication network that transmits information between the brain and the rest of the body (hands/feet).</li>
        <li><strong>Myelin Sheath:</strong> The fatty protective coating around nerve fibers. Think of it like the plastic coating on a phone charger. When it frays, the signal gets staticy (tingling) or painful.</li>
        <li><strong>Oxidative Stress:</strong> "Rust" on a cellular level. Nerves are highly susceptible to this rust, which is caused by toxins, sugar, and inflammation.</li>
        <li><strong>Vagus Nerve:</strong> The longest nerve in the body, connecting the brain to the gut. Inflammation in the gut travels up this nerve to the brain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Why Standard Management Fails</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">The "Mute Button" Approach</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Common nerve medications (like Gabapentin) work by blocking pain signals in the brain. They act like a "mute button" on a fire alarm.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> They do not put out the fire. The nerve damage continues to progress underneath the medication. When the meds wear off, the pain is often worse because the damage has spread.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: Why Nerves Degenerate</h2>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Sugar Glass" Effect (Glucose)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> High blood sugar is abrasive. On a microscopic level, excess glucose acts like shards of glass traveling through your blood vessels. It shreds the delicate capillaries that feed your nerves. <strong>Golden Vita Pure</strong> regulates sugar to stop this daily "sandpapering" effect.</p>

    <h3 class="text-blue-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Suffocation" (Circulation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Nerves have a massive appetite for oxygen. If your circulation is poor (cold hands/feet), the nerves literally suffocate. A suffocating nerve sends distress signals (pain) before it dies (numbness). <strong>AlphaFlow</strong> dilates blood vessels to flush the nerves with oxygen-rich blood.</p>

    <h3 class="text-green-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Toxic Signal" (Gut-Brain Axis)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> If your gut is inflamed (Leaky Gut), it sends inflammatory signals up the Vagus Nerve, causing systemic nerve sensitivity. You cannot heal the nerves if the gut is constantly irritating them. <strong>Probiotic Balance</strong> calms the gut to stop this inflammatory signal.</p>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Immune Attack" (Inflammation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Chronic inflammation causes the immune system to attack healthy tissue, including nerve sheaths (autoimmunity). <strong>Vital Defense</strong> regulates the immune response so it stops attacking your own wiring.</p>

    <h3 class="text-orange-600 font-bold mt-4">5. The "Physical Crush" (Compression)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Excess body weight or joint inflammation physically compresses nerve pathways (like stepping on a hose). <strong>Lipolyne</strong> (weight) and <strong>Optivell</strong> (joints) help remove the physical pressure crushing the nerves.</p>
