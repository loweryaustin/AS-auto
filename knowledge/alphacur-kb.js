        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> Sciatica is not just "back pain." It is the longest nerve in your body being strangled. Whether by inflammation, a slipped disc, or tight muscles, the nerve is screaming because it is being crushed. Relief requires decompressing the nerve and repairing the damage caused by the crushing.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Sciatic Nerve:</strong> The longest and widest nerve in the body, running from the lower back, through the hips, down each leg.</li>
        <li><strong>Radiculopathy:</strong> The medical term for "pinched nerve." Pain that radiates from the spine down the leg.</li>
        <li><strong>Piriformis Syndrome:</strong> When the piriformis muscle in the buttocks spasms and compresses the sciatic nerve. Often misdiagnosed as a disc issue.</li>
        <li><strong>Herniated Disc:</strong> When the soft cushion between vertebrae pushes out and presses on the nerve root. Inflammation makes this pressure worse.</li>
        <li><strong>Myelin Sheath Repair:</strong> Rebuilding the fatty insulation around the nerve. Compression strips this insulation away, causing the burning/electric sensation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Common Medications</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Muscle Relaxers (Flexeril, Cyclobenzaprine)</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> They sedate the central nervous system to force muscles to relax.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> They make you extremely drowsy and "loopy" but do not fix the inflammation or nerve damage. They are a "chemical nap," not a cure.</li>
        <li><strong>Side Effects:</strong> Extreme drowsiness, dry mouth, dizziness, confusion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Nerve Blockers (Gabapentin)</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Blocks pain signals from reaching the brain.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> It puts a "muzzle" on the dog but doesn't take the thorn out of its paw. The nerve continues to degenerate underneath the numbness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: Why the Pain Persists</h2>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Inflammatory Vice" (Compression)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Even if a disc is slightly bulging, it's the <em>inflammation</em> around it that causes the severe pain. Swollen tissue takes up space, crushing the nerve against the bone. <strong>Resverador</strong> acts as a powerful anti-inflammatory to "deflate" the swelling and release the vice grip.</p>

    <h3 class="text-yellow-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Frayed Wire" (Structural Damage)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> After being compressed for months or years, the nerve's insulation (Myelin) is stripped raw. This causes the shooting, electric shocks. <strong>AlphaCur</strong> and <strong>Arialief</strong> provide the specific nutrients needed to re-insulate the wire.</p>

    <h3 class="text-blue-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Oxygen Starvation" (Circulation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> A compressed nerve is a starved nerve. The pressure cuts off blood flow. Without oxygen, the nerve cannot heal. <strong>Tenurina</strong> forces blood into the area to flush out inflammatory toxins and bring in repair materials.</p>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Defense Gap" (Immunity)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Chronic pain suppresses the immune system. A weak immune system slows down tissue repair. <strong>Zalovira</strong> boosts immune function to ensure your body isn't fighting a war on two fronts (infection vs. repair).</p>
