    <h1>Gela Tide & Weight Loss Deep Dive</h1>
    
    <div class="p-4 bg-purple-50 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-purple-500 mb-6">
        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> Weight loss isn't just about calories; it's about <em>signaling</em>. If your body thinks it is starving (dieting) or under attack (stress), it will hoard fat for survival. Gela Tide changes the signal to "Satiated," while supporting supplements remove the "Stress" blocks.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Satiety:</strong> The feeling of being "full." This is controlled by hormones like Leptin. If you are Leptin Resistant, you never feel full, no matter how much you eat.</li>
        <li><strong>Cortisol:</strong> The "Stress Hormone." Evolutionarily, stress meant "famine is coming." So, high cortisol triggers the body to store visceral fat (belly fat) as an emergency reserve. You cannot burn fat while Cortisol is high.</li>
        <li><strong>Insulin Resistance:</strong> When cells stop listening to insulin, sugar stays in the blood and gets stored as fat instead of being burned for energy. This is the primary driver of stubborn weight gain.</li>
        <li><strong>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):</strong> How many calories you burn doing nothing. Yo-yo dieting slows this down ("Starvation Mode"). We need to speed it back up.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Why "Just Dieting" Fails</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">The Starvation Reflex</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> When you cut calories drastically, your body thinks you are in a famine.</li>
        <li><strong>The Response:</strong> It lowers your metabolism to save energy. You feel tired and cold. As soon as you eat normal food again, your body stores it <em>all</em> as fat to prepare for the next famine. This is the Yo-Yo effect.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">GLP-1 Agonists (Ozempic/Wegovy)</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> They chemically force the brain to stop wanting food.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> You lose muscle mass along with fat. Muscle is your metabolic engine. When you stop the drug, you have a slower metabolism than when you started, leading to rapid rebound weight gain.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Instituto Protocol: Signaling Safety</h2>

    <h3 class="text-blue-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Fullness Signal" (Appetite)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> <strong>Gela Tide</strong> acts as your discipline partner. It supports natural appetite control, helping your brain register "fullness" sooner. This allows you to eat smaller portions without feeling deprived or triggering the starvation reflex.</p>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Sugar Trap" (Insulin)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> If your blood sugar is spiking and crashing, you will have uncontrollable cravings. <strong>Gluco Control</strong> stabilizes glucose levels. Stable blood sugar means stable energy and zero cravings, making it easy to stick to the plan.</p>

    <h3 class="text-yellow-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Stress Block" (Cortisol)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> High stress (Cortisol) physically blocks fat burning. It puts a "lock" on your fat cells. <strong>Nerve Alive</strong> calms the nervous system, lowering Cortisol to remove the lock and allow the body to release stored fat.</p>

    <h3 class="text-orange-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Metabolic Fire" (Efficiency)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> If your metabolism is slow, you burn fewer calories. <strong>Flash Burn</strong> is the accelerator. It provides ingredients to kickstart the metabolic rate, helping you burn more calories at rest.</p>

    <h3 class="text-green-600 font-bold mt-4">5. The "Clean Slate" (Digestion)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> A clogged digestive tract reabsorbs toxins and wastes, causing inflammation and bloating. <strong>Flora Zen</strong> acts as a reset button, cleansing the system so nutrients can be absorbed and metabolism can run clean.</p>
