        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> Your mouth is an ecosystem. Most dental problems (cavities, bad breath, gum disease) happen because the "good guys" (beneficial bacteria) have been killed off by harsh mouthwashes, sugar, or antibiotics, letting the "bad guys" take over. We don't just clean the teeth; we rebalance the ecosystem.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Oral Microbiome:</strong> The community of bacteria living in your mouth. A healthy microbiome protects teeth. An unhealthy one eats them.</li>
        <li><strong>Streptococcus mutans:</strong> The specific "bad" bacteria that eats sugar and excretes acid. This acid is what dissolves tooth enamel (cavities).</li>
        <li><strong>Gingivitis:</strong> Inflammation of the gums. It's the first stage of gum disease. If your gums bleed when you floss, you have this.</li>
        <li><strong>Periodontitis:</strong> Advanced gum disease where the gum pulls away from the tooth, creating pockets that get infected. This leads to tooth loss.</li>
        <li><strong>Remineralization:</strong> The natural process where saliva deposits minerals (calcium/phosphate) back into the enamel to harden it.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Why Standard Care Fails</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Alcohol-Based Mouthwash</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> It acts like a forest fire, killing 99.9% of bacteria—both good and bad. This leaves the "soil" (your mouth) barren. When bacteria return, the aggressive bad ones (weeds) grow back faster than the good ones.</li>
        <li><strong>Dry Mouth:</strong> Alcohol dries out saliva. Saliva is your mouth's natural defense system. Less saliva = more cavities and worse breath.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Whitening Strips</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> They use harsh chemicals to bleach the tooth. This weakens the enamel and opens up the microscopic pores in the tooth, leading to severe sensitivity to hot/cold.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: Why Teeth Fail</h2>

    <h3 class="text-blue-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Acid Attack" (Sugar)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Cavities aren't just "holes." They are acid burns. When you eat sugar, bad bacteria eat it instantly and release acid as waste. This acid dissolves the calcium in your tooth. <strong>Cetadusse</strong> regulates blood sugar to starve these bacteria of their fuel source.</p>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Open Wound" (Inflammation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Healthy gums should not bleed. If they do, you have an open wound. This allows oral bacteria to enter your bloodstream and travel to your heart (linked to heart disease). <strong>Resverador</strong> stops the systemic inflammation causing the gums to swell and bleed.</p>

    <h3 class="text-yellow-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Internal Fumes" (Gut Health)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Chronic bad breath (Halitosis) that doesn't go away after brushing usually comes from the stomach, not the mouth. It is gas rising from poor digestion. <strong>GoldenFrib</strong> fixes the digestion so the "fumes" stop rising.</p>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Defense Failure" (Saliva/Immunity)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Your saliva is supposed to remineralize your teeth. If your body is mineral-deficient or your immune system is weak, your saliva loses its potency. <strong>Alitoryn</strong> restores the mineral balance and probiotic population to turn your saliva back into a defense shield.</p>
