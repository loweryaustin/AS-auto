        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> Vision loss isn't just "getting old"; it is a failure of support. The eye is the most energy-hungry organ in the body by weight. It requires massive amounts of Oxygen (Circulation), protection from Light Damage (Antioxidants), and a healthy connection to the brain (Optic Nerve). Optivell provides the foundation, but the rest of the stack ensures the delivery.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Macula:</strong> The center of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision (reading, driving). It is made of carotenoids (Lutein/Zeaxanthin) that act as a shield against light.</li>
        <li><strong>Optic Nerve:</strong> The biological cable connecting the eye to the brain. Glaucoma damages this cable. If the cable dies, the vision is lost permanently.</li>
        <li><strong>Blue Light:</strong> High-energy light waves from phones, computers, and LED bulbs. It penetrates deep into the eye, causing oxidative stress ("rust") that kills retinal cells over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Diabetic Retinopathy:</strong> When high blood sugar damages the blood vessels in the retina. They leak fluid or bleed, causing blindness.</li>
        <li><strong>Micro-Circulation:</strong> The eye is fed by capillaries thinner than a human hair. If you have high blood pressure or cholesterol, these are the first vessels to clog, starving the eye of oxygen.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Why Glasses Aren't a Cure</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">The "Lens vs. Retina" Distinction</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Glasses:</strong> Correct the <em>focus</em> of light (like a camera lens).</li>
        <li><strong>Optivell:</strong> Supports the <em>film</em> (the Retina). If the film is damaged (Macular Degeneration), it doesn't matter how good the lens is; the picture will still be blank. You must feed the retina to save your vision.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: Why Vision Fades</h2>

    <h3 class="text-yellow-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Sugar Spike" (Retinopathy)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Glucose is sticky. When blood sugar is high, it gums up the tiny vessels in the eye. They become brittle and leak. This is the leading cause of blindness in adults. <strong>Golden Vita Pure</strong> regulates sugar to stop this vessel destruction.</p>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Oxygen Starvation" (Circulation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> The optic nerve dies without oxygen (Glaucoma). Because the vessels are so small, even minor circulation issues cut off the supply. <strong>AlphaFlow</strong> dilates these micro-vessels to flush the eye with oxygen-rich blood.</p>

    <h3 class="text-green-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Broken Cable" (Optic Nerve)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> The eye is useless if the signal can't get to the brain. The optic nerve is a bundle of nerve fibers. Like any nerve, it needs insulation (myelin) and repair nutrients. <strong>Nervital</strong> supports this specific nerve structure to keep the signal clear.</p>

    <h3 class="text-blue-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Digital Burn" (Blue Light)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> We stare at screens for 10+ hours a day. This unnatural light creates massive amounts of free radicals in the eye tissue. <strong>Neurodyne</strong> provides the systemic antioxidants needed to neutralize this oxidative stress before it kills the cells.</p>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">5. The "Absorption Wall" (Gut Health)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Vision nutrients like Zeaxanthin are fat-soluble and notoriously hard to absorb. If your gut lining is inflamed or sluggish, these expensive nutrients pass right through you. <strong>Probiotic Balance</strong> ensures you actually absorb the ingredients in Optivell.</p>
