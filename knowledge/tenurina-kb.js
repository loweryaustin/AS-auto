        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> High Blood Pressure is not a disease; it is a symptom of a blocked or stiff system. Your heart is only pumping harder because it <em>has</em> to in order to push blood through resistant pipes. We don't just force the pressure down; we open the pipes (Vasodilation).</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Vasodilation:</strong> The widening of blood vessels. This naturally lowers blood pressure because the "pipes" are bigger, reducing resistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Endothelium:</strong> The inner lining of your arteries. It releases Nitric Oxide to tell the vessel to relax. If this lining is damaged (by sugar or smoking), the vessel stays stiff and constricted.</li>
        <li><strong>Microcirculation:</strong> Blood flow in the tiniest capillaries (eyes, fingers, toes, kidneys). This is the first place circulation fails, leading to cold hands/feet and organ damage.</li>
        <li><strong>Hypertension:</strong> Chronically high pressure against artery walls. Over time, this causes the heart muscle to thicken and weaken (Heart Failure).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Common Medications</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Beta Blockers (Metoprolol)</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Blocks adrenaline from hitting the heart, forcing it to beat slower and softer.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> It makes you tired and sluggish because your heart literally cannot pump hard enough to support exercise or energy. It treats the pump, not the clogged pipes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Diuretics (Water Pills)</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Flushes water and salt out of the body to lower blood volume. Less liquid = less pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> Dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and kidney strain. It doesn't fix the vessel stiffness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: Why Pressure Rises</h2>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Scarred Pipe" (Sugar)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> High blood sugar acts like sandpaper, scratching the inside of your arteries. Your body patches these scratches with cholesterol (plaque). Over time, the pipe gets narrower and stiffer. <strong>Cetadusse</strong> stops the sugar damage so the arteries can heal.</p>

    <h3 class="text-blue-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Nerve Starvation" (Neuropathy)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Nerves have a huge oxygen demand. If circulation is poor, nerves in the feet suffocate and die (Neuropathy). Improving circulation with Tenurina is often the key to reversing numbness. <strong>Arialief</strong> rebuilds the nerve once the blood flow is restored.</p>

    <h3 class="text-orange-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "External Squeeze" (Swelling)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> If the tissues surrounding your blood vessels are swollen (edema), they physically compress the veins from the outside. The heart has to pump harder to push through the squeeze. <strong>Resverador</strong> reduces this systemic swelling.</p>

    <h3 class="text-yellow-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Extra Mileage" (Weight)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> For every pound of fat, your body creates roughly a mile of new capillaries. That is miles of extra tubing your heart has to pump through. Losing weight physically shortens the distance the heart has to work. <strong>Laellium</strong> sheds this extra load.</p>
