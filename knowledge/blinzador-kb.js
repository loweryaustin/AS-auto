        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> You cannot fix a systemic fungal infection with a topical spray alone. The fungus on your toes is just the "fruit" of the tree; the "roots" are in your gut (Candida) and blood (Sugar). We must attack root-to-fruit.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Onychomycosis:</strong> The medical term for fungal infection of the nail. It is notoriously difficult to cure because the fungus lives *under* the hard nail plate.</li>
        <li><strong>Candida Albicans:</strong> A yeast that lives in the gut. When it overgrows (due to sugar or antibiotics), it becomes systemic, manifesting as foot fungus, jock itch, or thrush.</li>
        <li><strong>Dermatophytes:</strong> The specific family of fungi that feed on keratin (the protein in skin and nails).</li>
        <li><strong>Keratin:</strong> The hard protein that makes up your nails. Fungus eats this, which is why nails turn yellow, brittle, and crumbly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Common Medications</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Lamisil (Terbinafine) - Oral</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> An antifungal pill taken for 3-6 months.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> It is extremely toxic to the liver. Doctors require monthly liver enzyme blood tests while you are on it. It puts massive stress on your system.</li>
        <li><strong>Side Effects:</strong> Liver damage, loss of taste, severe rash.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Topical Lacquers (Jublia, Kerydin)</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> Painted on the nail like polish.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> The nail is designed to keep things *out*. These medicines have very poor penetration rates (often less than 10% success) because they can't get deep enough to kill the root.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: Why It Comes Back</h2>

    <h3 class="text-yellow-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Internal Source" (Gut)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> If you have athlete's foot that won't go away, it's often re-seeding from your own digestive tract. Candida overgrowth leaks into the bloodstream and settles in the extremities. <strong>GoldenFrib</strong> rebalances the gut microbiome to kill the source.</p>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Fuel Source" (Sugar)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Fungus feeds on sugar. If your blood glucose is high (Diabetes/Pre-Diabetes), you are literally an "all-you-can-eat buffet" for the fungus. It will grow faster than you can kill it. <strong>Cetadusse</strong> regulates blood sugar to starve the infection.</p>

    <h3 class="text-blue-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Delivery Failure" (Circulation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> The immune system fights infection via white blood cells in the blood. The feet are the furthest point from the heart. If circulation is poor (cold feet), your immune army can't get to the battlefield. <strong>Tenurina</strong> drives blood flow to the toes to deliver the body's defenses.</p>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Swamp" (Inflammation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Chronic inflammation causes tissue to hold water (swelling). Fungus loves warm, damp, dark environments. Inflamed, swollen feet create the perfect breeding ground. <strong>Resverador</strong> reduces swelling to dry out the swamp.</p>
