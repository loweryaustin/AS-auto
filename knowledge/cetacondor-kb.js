        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> Nerves are biological wires. When the insulation (Myelin) is stripped, the wire shorts out (Burning Pain). If the damage continues, the wire snaps (Numbness). Cetacondor is the "insulation repair kit."</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Peripheral Neuropathy:</strong> Damage to the peripheral nervous system (hands and feet). It is a progressive condition, meaning it starts at the toes and moves up the leg.</li>
        <li><strong>Myelin Sheath:</strong> The fatty protective coating around the nerve. Think of it like the rubber coating on an electrical cord. When this is damaged, the "bare wire" is exposed.</li>
        <li><strong>Small Fiber Neuropathy:</strong> Damage to the tiny nerve fibers in the skin that sense pain and temperature. This is usually the first stage (Burning/Tingling).</li>
        <li><strong>Large Fiber Neuropathy:</strong> Damage to the nerves that control balance and muscle movement. This is the later stage (Numbness/Falls).</li>
        <li><strong>Paresthesia:</strong> The sensation of "pins and needles" or ants crawling on the skin.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. The "Band-Aid" Medications</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Gabapentin (Neurontin) & Lyrica (Pregabalin)</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> These are anti-seizure drugs. They work by blocking calcium channels in the brain to "dampen" the electrical signal of pain. They turn down the volume knob.</li>
        <li><strong>The Trap:</strong> They do <strong>zero</strong> repair work on the nerve itself. The nerve continues to die silently while the patient feels "relief." When they stop the drug, the pain is often worse because the damage has progressed.</li>
        <li><strong>Side Effects:</strong> "The Zombie Effect" (Severe brain fog), dizziness (increasing fall risk), weight gain, and edema (swelling).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: Why Nerves Die</h2>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Sugar Glass" Effect (Glucose)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> High blood sugar is abrasive. On a microscopic level, glucose crystals act like shards of glass in the bloodstream. As blood flows over the delicate nerves, these "shards" shred the Myelin Sheath. <strong>Cetadusse</strong> regulates sugar to stop the shredding.</p>

    <h3 class="text-blue-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Suffocation" (Ischemia)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Nerves need oxygen to survive. They are fed by tiny capillaries (vasa nervorum). High blood pressure or cholesterol clogs these tiny pipes. The nerve suffocates and dies. <strong>Tenurina</strong> forces these vessels open to flush the nerve with oxygen.</p>

    <h3 class="text-orange-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Compression" (Inflammation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> If the tissue around the nerve is inflamed (swollen), it crushes the nerve. It's like stepping on a garden hose; the flow stops. <strong>Resverador</strong> acts as a systemic anti-inflammatory to take the pressure off the hose.</p>
