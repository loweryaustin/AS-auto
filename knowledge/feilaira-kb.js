        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> Arthritis is not just "wear and tear." It is often a failure of repair. Your joints are constantly breaking down and rebuilding. When inflammation is too high or blood flow is too low, the breakdown outpaces the repair. We must reverse this ratio.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Synovial Fluid:</strong> The "oil" in your joints that lubricates movement. As we age or get dehydrated, this fluid dries up, causing "bone-on-bone" grinding.</li>
        <li><strong>Cartilage:</strong> The shock absorber between bones. Unlike muscle, cartilage has <strong>no direct blood supply</strong> (avascular). It gets nutrients only through "diffusion" from surrounding fluids. This makes it incredibly hard to heal.</li>
        <li><strong>Systemic Inflammation:</strong> Inflammation that affects the whole body, not just one knee. Often caused by gut issues (Leaky Gut), sugar, or stress. The body attacks its own joints.</li>
        <li><strong>Autoimmune (RA):</strong> Rheumatoid Arthritis is when the immune system mistakenly attacks the joint lining. This requires immune modulation, not just pain relief.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Common Medications</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Naproxen, Celebrex)</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> They block enzymes (COX-1/COX-2) that create inflammation signals.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> They stop the pain signal but also stop the *healing* signal. Long-term use destroys the stomach lining (ulcers) and puts heavy strain on the kidneys and liver.</li>
        <li><strong>Side Effects:</strong> Stomach pain, ulcers, high blood pressure, kidney damage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Corticosteroids (Prednisone, Cortisone Shots)</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> A powerful synthetic hormone that shuts down the immune system's inflammatory response.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> It is catabolic (breaks down tissue). Repeated steroid shots actually <em>weaken</em> tendons and cartilage over time, accelerating joint degeneration.</li>
        <li><strong>Side Effects:</strong> Weight gain, "Moon Face," thin skin, high blood sugar, weakened bones (osteoporosis).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: Why Joints Fail</h2>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Starving Joint" (Circulation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Since cartilage has no blood vessels, it relies on nutrients diffusing from the bone underneath. If circulation is poor (High BP, cold hands/feet), the "food supply" to the joint is cut off. The cartilage starves and cracks. <strong>Tenurina</strong> forces blood into the micro-vessels surrounding the joint to feed it.</p>

    <h3 class="text-yellow-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Internal Fire" (Gut Health)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> "Leaky Gut" allows toxins into the bloodstream. The immune system attacks these toxins, creating systemic inflammation that settles in the joints. You cannot fix the knee if the gut is still leaking poison. <strong>GoldenFrib</strong> seals the gut to stop the source of inflammation.</p>

    <h3 class="text-blue-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Heavy Load" (Weight/Mechanics)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Physics is brutal. For every 1 pound of body weight, you place <strong>4 pounds</strong> of pressure on your knees. Losing just 10lbs takes 40lbs of grinding pressure off the joint. <strong>Laellium</strong> helps shed this mechanical load.</p>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "No Repair" Zone (Sleep)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Connective tissue (ligaments, tendons, cartilage) has a very slow turnover rate. The majority of repair happens during Deep (Delta) Sleep. If pain keeps you awake, you miss the construction window. <strong>Xelovita</strong> ensures you stay asleep long enough to heal.</p>
