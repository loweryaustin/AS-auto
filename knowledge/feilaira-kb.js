        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> Arthritis is not just "wear and tear"; it is a failure of repair. Your joints are living tissue. However, they are <em>avascular</em> (no blood supply). They starve easily. Feilaira provides the building blocks, but we must also improve the delivery system (Circulation) and reduce the load (Weight).</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Avascular:</strong> "Without blood vessels." Cartilage gets its nutrients only by absorbing fluid from the surrounding tissue, like a sponge. This makes it the slowest tissue to heal.</li>
        <li><strong>Synovial Fluid:</strong> The "motor oil" of the joint. As we age or get dehydrated, this fluid dries up, leading to "bone-on-bone" grinding.</li>
        <li><strong>Systemic Inflammation:</strong> Inflammation that comes from the blood (sugar, gut toxins) rather than an injury. It attacks all joints at once (hands, knees, hips).</li>
        <li><strong>Mechanical Load:</strong> The physics of weight. For every 1 lb of body weight, the knee takes 4 lbs of pressure. Losing 10 lbs reduces knee pressure by 40 lbs per step.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Common Medications vs. Healing</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Naproxen)</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> They block the enzymes that cause pain signals.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> They stop the pain but also stop the <em>healing</em> signal. Long-term use degrades cartilage and destroys the stomach lining. They manage the symptom while the joint continues to crumble.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Cortisone Shots</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> A powerful steroid that shuts down inflammation instantly.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> It is catabolic (breaks down tissue). Repeated shots weaken tendons and cartilage, accelerating the need for joint replacement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: Why Joints Fail</h2>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Starving Joint" (Circulation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Since cartilage can't get blood directly, it relies on the blood flow in the surrounding tissue. If you have cold hands/feet or high blood pressure, your micro-circulation is clamped shut. The joint starves. <strong>Tenurina</strong> opens these vessels to feed the tissue.</p>

    <h3 class="text-blue-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Heavy Load" (Weight)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> You cannot out-supplement physics. If you are 50 lbs overweight, that is 200 lbs of extra grinding pressure on your knees with every single step. <strong>Laellium</strong> helps shed this weight to physically save the joint.</p>

    <h3 class="text-green-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Toxic Leak" (Gut Health)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> "Leaky Gut" allows bacterial toxins (LPS) into the bloodstream. These toxins lodge in the joints, triggering the immune system to attack (Autoimmune/Rheumatoid response). <strong>GoldenFrib</strong> seals the gut to stop this internal attack.</p>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "False Alarm" (Nerves)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Sometimes the joint structure is fine, but the nerves <em>around</em> the joint are hypersensitive. This feels like sharp, electric pain. <strong>Arialief</strong> calms these nerves so you can move without pain.</p>
