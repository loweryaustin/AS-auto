    <h1>Cetadusse & Metabolic Health Deep Dive</h1>

        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> High blood sugar is not just an "energy" issue; it is a toxicity issue. Excess glucose acts like microscopic shards of glass, shredding nerves, scarring arteries, and inflaming joints. Cetadusse is the regulator that stops this toxicity.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Insulin Resistance:</strong> The "Broken Lock." Your cells have doors for sugar. Insulin is the key. When you have too much sugar, the lock jams. Sugar stays in the blood (toxicity) while cells starve for energy.</li>
        <li><strong>Glycation:</strong> The process where sugar binds to proteins (like collagen) and "cooks" them. This makes blood vessels stiff (High BP), joints creaky (Arthritis), and skin wrinkled.</li>
        <li><strong>A1C:</strong> A 3-month average of your blood sugar. It measures what percentage of your red blood cells are sugar-coated. <br><strong>Normal:</strong> Below 5.7% <br><strong>Diabetes:</strong> 6.5% or higher.</li>
        <li><strong>Visceral Fat:</strong> The "Active Fat" in the belly. It releases chemicals that actively block insulin from working.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Why "Just Cutting Carbs" Isn't Enough</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">The Liver Dump</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>The Mechanism:</strong> Your liver stores sugar (glycogen). If you are stressed (Cortisol) or have poor sleep, your liver dumps this sugar into your blood, even if you haven't eaten a single carb.</li>
        <li><strong>The Solution:</strong> You must regulate the liver's production of sugar. Cetadusse supports healthy liver function to control this internal source.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: The Toxicity Cascade</h2>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Nerve Rot" (Neuropathy)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Sugar is neurotoxic. It dissolves the fatty insulation (Myelin) around your nerves. This causes the "short circuit" pain of neuropathy. <strong>Cetacondor</strong> provides the materials to rebuild this insulation once Cetadusse stops the attack.</p>

    <h3 class="text-blue-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Stiff Vessel" (Heart Health)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Sugar scratches the inside of arteries. The body patches these scratches with plaque, leading to stiff, narrow arteries. <strong>Tenurina</strong> heals the vessel lining to restore flexibility and protect the heart.</p>

    <h3 class="text-green-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Fat Blockade" (Weight)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Visceral fat causes insulin resistance. You cannot fix your sugar until you fix your belly. <strong>Laellium</strong> burns this specific type of fat to unclog the metabolic system.</p>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Craving Cycle" (Gut)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Bad bacteria and yeast (Candida) feed on sugar. They hijack the Vagus Nerve to make you crave sweets. <strong>GoldenFrib</strong> cleans the gut to stop these cravings so you can stick to your diet.</p>

    <h3 class="text-orange-600 font-bold mt-4">5. The "Rusty Joint" (Glycation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Sugar-coated joints are stiff joints. Glycation makes collagen brittle. <strong>Resverador</strong> reduces the systemic inflammation in these stiff tissues to restore mobility.</p>
