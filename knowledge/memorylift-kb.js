        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> The brain is an expensive organ. It makes up 2% of your weight but consumes 20% of your energy. If your body is struggling (poor circulation, gut issues, stress), it cuts the budget to the brain first. Memory loss is a supply chain failure.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Gut-Brain Axis:</strong> The physical and chemical connection between your gut and your brain. 90% of your Serotonin (the focus/happy chemical) is made in your gut, not your brain.</li>
        <li><strong>Neuroplasticity:</strong> The brain's ability to form new connections. This is how we learn and remember. Stress and inflammation stop this process.</li>
        <li><strong>Hippocampus:</strong> The part of the brain responsible for memory. It is highly sensitive to Cortisol (stress) and can physically shrink if stress is chronic.</li>
        <li><strong>Micro-Circulation:</strong> The tiny blood vessels that feed brain cells. If these clog (due to sugar or cholesterol), brain cells starve and die (vascular dementia).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. The "Fog" Causes</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-green-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Empty Tank" (Gut Health)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> "It's on the tip of my tongue." That is a Recall issue. Recall requires neurotransmitters like Acetylcholine. These are built from nutrients absorbed in the gut. If your gut is sluggish, you aren't making the fuel. <strong>Vital Green</strong> provides the raw materials to rebuild the supply.</p>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Oxygen Starvation" (Circulation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Brain fog is often just a lack of oxygen. If you have cold hands/feet, you likely have poor flow to the brain too. <strong>Vital Blood</strong> boosts Nitric Oxide to open the "pipes" and flush the brain with oxygen-rich blood.</p>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Static Noise" (Stress)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Trying to remember something while stressed is like trying to hear a whisper at a rock concert. Cortisol creates "noise" in the brain. <strong>Nerve Alive</strong> calms the nervous system, lowering the volume so you can think clearly again.</p>

    <h3 class="text-yellow-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Inflamed Brain" (Sugar)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> High blood sugar causes inflammation that crosses the blood-brain barrier. Scientists now call Alzheimer's "Type 3 Diabetes." <strong>Gluco Control</strong> stabilizes sugar to stop this inflammatory attack on your neurons.</p>
