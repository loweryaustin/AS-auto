        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> Your brain is a high-performance engine that requires three things to run: Structure (Architecture), Fuel (Blood/Oxygen), and Maintenance (Sleep/Antioxidants). Neuro Gold rebuilds the structure, while the rest of the stack provides the fuel and maintenance.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Neuroplasticity:</strong> The brain's ability to re-wire itself. It allows you to learn new things and remember old ones. This process slows down with age but can be reactivated.</li>
        <li><strong>Acetylcholine:</strong> The "Learning Neurotransmitter." It is essential for memory recall and focus. Low levels are directly linked to "Senior Moments" and cognitive decline.</li>
        <li><strong>Glymphatic System:</strong> The brain's waste clearance system. It <em>only</em> turns on during deep sleep to wash away toxic proteins (like amyloid plaques) that cause Alzheimer's.</li>
        <li><strong>Oxidative Stress:</strong> "Brain Rust." Free radicals damage brain cells over time. Antioxidants are the rust-proofing that protects neurons from dying.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Why "Just Doing Crosswords" Fails</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">The Hardware vs. Software Problem</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Analogy:</strong> Doing puzzles is like installing new software. It's great, but if your computer's hardware (brain cells) is broken or the power supply (blood flow) is cut, the software won't run.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> We must fix the hardware first. We supply the physical nutrients needed to build healthy neurons and the blood flow to power them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: Why the Engine Stalls</h2>

    <h3 class="text-green-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Toxic Buildup" (Sleep)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> If you don't sleep deeply, your brain's Glymphatic System never turns on. Toxic waste accumulates, physically clogging the connections between neurons. This is the primary driver of long-term decline. <strong>Night Renew</strong> ensures you reach the deep sleep stages required for this "brain wash."</p>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Fuel Shortage" (Circulation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> The brain is 2% of your weight but uses 20% of your oxygen. It has no energy reserves. If blood flow drops even slightly (due to cold hands/feet or poor vessels), brain function dims instantly to save power. <strong>AlphaFlow</strong> opens the "fuel lines" to restore full power.</p>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Inflammatory Fog" (Sugar)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> High blood sugar creates inflammation that crosses the blood-brain barrier. This inflammation acts like static noise, making it hard to think clearly or form memories. <strong>Golden Vita Pure</strong> regulates sugar to stop this inflammatory attack.</p>

    <h3 class="text-orange-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Sensory Overload" (Tinnitus/Pain)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> The brain has a limited amount of processing power. If it is constantly processing pain signals (Neuropathy) or phantom sounds (Tinnitus), there is no power left for memory or focus. <strong>Nervital</strong> and <strong>NeuroSilence</strong> quiet these distractions so the brain can focus on thinking.</p>
