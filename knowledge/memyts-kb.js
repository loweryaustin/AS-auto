        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> The brain is an expensive organ. It makes up 2% of your weight but consumes 20% of your energy. If your body is struggling (poor circulation, gut issues, stress), it will "budget cut" the brain first. Memory loss is a supply chain failure.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Gut-Brain Axis:</strong> The physical connection (Vagus Nerve) between your gut and brain. 90% of Serotonin (focus/happiness) and 50% of Dopamine (motivation) are made in the gut.</li>
        <li><strong>Neuroplasticity:</strong> The brain's ability to re-wire itself and form new memories. This process requires BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor). Inflammation stops BDNF production.</li>
        <li><strong>Hippocampus:</strong> The part of the brain responsible for memory storage. It is highly sensitive to Cortisol (stress) and can physically shrink if stress is chronic.</li>
        <li><strong>Micro-Circulation:</strong> The tiny blood vessels that feed brain cells. If these clog (due to sugar or plaque), brain cells starve and die (Vascular Dementia).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Why "Brain Games" Aren't Enough</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Hardware vs. Software</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Analogy:</strong> Doing crosswords is like installing new software. It's great, but if your computer's hardware (brain cells) is broken or the power supply (blood flow) is cut, the software won't run.</li>
        <li><strong>Solution:</strong> We must fix the hardware first. Memyts supplies the nutrients to build neurons, while our bridges ensure they get fed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: The "Supply Chain" Failure</h2>

    <h3 class="text-green-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Empty Tank" (Gut Health)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> "It's on the tip of my tongue." That is a Recall issue. Recall requires neurotransmitters. If your gut is sluggish or inflamed, you aren't making the chemical fuel your brain needs to retrieve data. <strong>GoldenFrib</strong> repairs the factory.</p>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Oxygen Starvation" (Circulation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Brain fog is often just a lack of oxygen. If you have cold hands/feet, you likely have poor flow to the brain too. <strong>Tenurina</strong> boosts Nitric Oxide to open the "pipes" and flush the brain with oxygen-rich blood.</p>

    <h3 class="text-purple-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Static Noise" (Inflammation)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> Systemic inflammation creates "noise" in the brain. It's like trying to have a conversation at a rock concert. The brain has to work 10x harder to process simple thoughts. <strong>Resverador</strong> lowers the volume so you can think clearly again.</p>

    <h3 class="text-yellow-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Data Loss" (Sleep)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> You don't store memories while you are awake; you store them while you sleep. If you don't hit Deep Sleep, the day's data is deleted. <strong>Xelovita</strong> ensures the "Save" function runs every night.</p>

    <h3 class="text-orange-600 font-bold mt-4">5. The "Sugar Rust" (Diet)</h3>
    <p><strong>The Science:</strong> High blood sugar causes inflammation that crosses the blood-brain barrier. Scientists now call Alzheimer's "Type 3 Diabetes." <strong>Cetadusse</strong> stabilizes sugar to stop this inflammatory attack on your neurons.</p>
