        <p class="text-sm italic"><strong>The Core Concept:</strong> The brain is an expensive organ. It consumes 20% of your body's energy. If your body is struggling with inflammation, digestion, or circulation, it will "budget cut" the brain first. Memory loss is often a supply chain failure.</p>

    <h2>1. Medical Glossary</h2>
    <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li><strong>Gut-Brain Axis:</strong> The physical and chemical connection between your gut and your brain via the Vagus Nerve. 90% of your Serotonin (the "happy/focus" chemical) is made in the gut, not the brain.</li>
        <li><strong>Neuroinflammation:</strong> Inflammation in the brain. It acts like "static" on a radio, disrupting clear thinking and causing Brain Fog.</li>
        <li><strong>Micro-Circulation:</strong> Blood flow in the tiniest capillaries. The brain needs a constant, massive supply of oxygen. If these tiny vessels clog, brain cells suffocate and die (dementia).</li>
        <li><strong>Acetylcholine:</strong> A neurotransmitter crucial for memory and learning. Most dementia meds try to stop this chemical from breaking down.</li>
        <li><strong>Recall vs. Retention:</strong> <em>Retention</em> is storing the memory. <em>Recall</em> is finding it again. "It's on the tip of my tongue" is a Recall (Gut) issue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Common Medications</h2>
    
    <h3 class="text-indigo-600 font-bold mt-4">Aricept (Donepezil) & Namenda (Memantine)</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Mechanism:</strong> They block the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, theoretically keeping levels higher in the brain.</li>
        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> They are "maintenance" drugs, not "repair" drugs. They are trying to squeeze the last drops out of a drying sponge. They do not fix the blood flow or inflammation causing the sponge to dry out.</li>
        <li><strong>Side Effects:</strong> Severe nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite (which worsens nutrient deficiency), muscle cramps, and insomnia.</li>
        <li><strong>Our Approach:</strong> We feed the brain the raw materials it needs to repair itself and restore the supply lines (blood/gut).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. The Root Causes: The "Supply Chain" Failure</h2>

    <h3 class="text-yellow-600 font-bold mt-4">1. The "Empty Tank" (Gut Health)</h3>
    <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> "I know the word, but I can't say it." (Recall)<br>
    <strong>The Science:</strong> The chemicals required to "fetch" a memory (Serotonin/Dopamine) are manufactured in the gut. If your gut is unhealthy (candida, poor diet, antibiotics), you aren't making enough fuel. <strong>GoldenFrib</strong> repairs the factory.</p>

    <h3 class="text-red-600 font-bold mt-4">2. The "Suffocation" (Circulation)</h3>
    <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Dizziness, "Senior Moments," General decline.<br>
    <strong>The Science:</strong> Brain cells are extremely sensitive to oxygen deprivation. High BP damages vessels; Low BP fails to push blood up against gravity. <strong>Tenurina</strong> ensures the pump is strong enough to get oxygen to the top floor.</p>

    <h3 class="text-orange-600 font-bold mt-4">3. The "Static Noise" (Inflammation)</h3>
    <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Brain Fog, trouble focusing, confusion.<br>
    <strong>The Science:</strong> Systemic inflammation (from arthritis, diet, or infection) crosses the blood-brain barrier. It creates "noise" that disrupts neural signals. It's hard to have a conversation in a noisy room. <strong>Resverador</strong> lowers the volume so the brain can think clearly.</p>

    <h3 class="text-blue-600 font-bold mt-4">4. The "Resource Theft" (Trauma/Pain)</h3>
    <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Sharp decline after a surgery, fall, or arthritis flare-up.<br>
    <strong>The Science:</strong> The body prioritizes survival over calculus. If you have a broken hip or severe arthritis, the body sends all its repair nutrients to the injury, starving the brain. <strong>Feilaira</strong> handles the physical pain so the body can stop diverting resources.</p>
